            <p>It's hard to experiment with music if you're not a virtuoso. A lot of remembering is involved. Pick out a nice melody? Now you have to keep it in mind going forward. Find a nice harmonic progression? Make sure you write it down. The music has to largely exist inside your head. Why not set it free?</p>

            <p>Composer's Sketchpad takes the strain off your mind. This is a modern take on sheet music. Scroll around an enormous canvas and place notes wherever you want. Start notes at any time and any pitch, and bend them as you wish! (Or use the snapping tools if you're feeling more conservative.) Play your music back immediately. Pick from a large assortment of instruments. Save any number of pieces.</p>

                <li class="question">
                    <h2>What's with the slightly weird interface?</h2>
                    <p>Most drawing apps let you draw with one finger and pan around with two. Personally, I've never had this work well; you often have to try multiple times to get it to work, and momentum scrolling is a huge pile of glitches. For this app, I wanted scrolling to be seamless without compromising on drawing. The mental model is actually quite simple: you have to hold down the canvas with one finger before you start drawing, as with a particularly slippery piece of paper. It quickly becomes second nature!</p>
                </li>

                <li class="question">
                    <h2>Why no MIDI in/out support?</h2>
                    <p>One of the starring features of Composer's Sketchpad is the ability for any note to start at, and bend to, any pitch. Unfortunately, MIDI pitch bends are done per-channel, which means that the MIDI output for this app will be very complicated and ill-suited to most apps. If you know of a standard way to pitch-bend individual MIDI notes, I'd love to hear about it! (I'm aware of polyphonic aftertouch, but my understanding is that you have to set the mapping to pitch per-sequencer, making MIDI-out too much of a hassle for most use cases.)</p>
                </li>

                <li class="question">
                    <h2>This doesn't have my favorite DAW features!</h2>
                    <p>I wrote this app largely because DAWs clouded my mind every time I sat down in front of them! I wanted an interface that made it as easy and frictionless as possible to actually put down notes and play them back. As a result, the app is very simple in construction, but powerful in usability. With that said, this app is a long-term project that's going to grow along with me over the years, and I fully intend to add more advanced features over time. The question is whether they can be added withotu complicating the interface. If you have ideas for power features that would work well for Composer's Sketchpad, by all means, please send me an e-mail!</p>
                </li>

                <li class="question">
                    <h2>What features are next in the pipeline?</h2>
                    <p>In terms of major features, MP3 export and iPhone support are the highest priority. I'll also be looking into Audiobus, virtual instruments, and MIDI file import. Of course, there are tons of smaller and more esoteric features that I'll be adding, too! (But I don't want to spill all the beans quite yet<a href="http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/">.</a>)</p>

            <p><strong>If you have any questions or bugs to report, please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:support@composerssketchpad.com">support@composerssketchpad.com</a>.</strong></p>

            <p>I'm a huge proponent of open source software, and I'd love to release the code for this project as soon as possible. For competitive reasons, I intend to do this either after I hit my sales benchmark, or after a long enough period of time has passed. I realize this sounds pretty wishy-washy right now, but I want to at least put this out there as a sort of pledge. Stay tuned!</p>
