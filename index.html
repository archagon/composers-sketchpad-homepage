            <h1>Questions</h1>
            <ul>
                <li class="question">
                    <h2>What's with the slightly weird interface?</h2>
                    <p>Most drawing apps let you draw with one finger and pan around with two. Personally, I've never found this to work well: you often have to try multiple times just to trigger it, to say nothing of momentum scrolling and the like. For this app, I wanted scrolling to be seamless without compromising on drawing. The mental model is actually quite simple: your "piece of paper" is very slippery, so you have to hold it down with one finger before you can start putting down notes. It quickly becomes second nature!</p>
                </li>

                <li class="question">
                    <h2>Why no MIDI in/out support?</h2>
                    <p>One of the starring features of Composer's Sketchpad is the ability for any note to start at, and bend to, any pitch. Unfortunately, MIDI pitch bends are done per-channel, which means that the MIDI output for this app will be very complicated and ill-suited to most apps. If you know of a standard way to pitch-bend individual MIDI notes, I'd love to hear about it! (I'm aware of polyphonic aftertouch, but my understanding is that you have to set the mapping to pitch per-sequencer, making MIDI-out too much of a hassle for most use cases.)</p>
                </li>

                <li class="question">
                    <h2>This doesn't have my favorite DAW features!</h2>
                    <p>I largely wrote this app because I found DAWs to be a poor model for how I create music. There was too much UI getting in the way of the actual compositional process, and too many features targeting audio production tweaks over the structure of the music itself. I wanted an interface that made it as easy and frictionless as possible to put down notes, edit them, and play them back — that's it. As a result, my app is limited in features, but powerful in usability. With that said, Composer's Sketchpad is a long-term project that is going to grow with me and adapt to my needs over the years, and I fully intend to add more advanced features over time. The question is whether they can be added without complicating the interface. If you have ideas for power features that would work well for Composer's Sketchpad, by all means, please send me an e-mail!</p>
                </li>

                <li class="question">
                    <h2>What features are next in the pipeline?</h2>
                    <p>In terms of major features, iPhone support is the highest priority. I'll also be looking into Audiobus, virtual instruments, MIDI file import, and MP3 export. Of course, there are tons of smaller and more esoteric features that I'll be adding, too! (But I don't want to spill all the beans quite yet<a href="http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/">.</a>)</p>

                <p>I'm a huge proponent of open source software, and I'd love to release the code for this project as soon as possible. For competitive reasons, I intend to do this either after I hit my sales benchmark, or after a long enough period of time has passed.
