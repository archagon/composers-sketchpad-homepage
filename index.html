            <p>It's hard to experiment with music if you're not a virtuoso. A lot of remembering is involved. Pick out a nice melody? Now you have to keep it in mind going forward. Find a nice harmonic progression? Make sure you don't let it slip. And what about putting everything together?</p>

            <p>Composer's Sketchpad makes composing music quick and intuitive.</p>

                <li class="question">
                    <h2>What's with the weird controls?</h2>
                    <p>Most drawing apps let you draw with one finger and pan around with two. Personally, I've never had this work well; you often have to try multiple times to get it to work, and you can forget about momentum scrolling. For this app, I wanted scrolling to be seamless without compromising on drawing. The mental model is actually quite simple: you have to hold down the canvas with one finger before you start drawing.</p>
                </li>

                <li class="question">
                    <h2>Why no MIDI in/out support?</h2>
                    <p>One of the starring features of Composer's Sketchpad is the ability for any note to start at, and bend to, any pitch. Unfortunately, MIDI pitch bends are done per-channel, which means that the MIDI output for this app will be very complicated and ill-suited to most apps. If you know of a standard way to pitch-bend individual MIDI notes, I'd love to hear about it!</p>
                </li>

                <li class="question">
                    <h2>What features are in the pipeline?</h2>
                    <p>In terms of major features, MP3 export and iPhone support are the highest priority. I'll also be looking into Audiobus support. Of course, there are tons of smaller and more esoteric features that I'll be adding, too! (But I don't want to spill all the beans quite yet<a href="http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/">.</a>)</p>

            <p>I'm a huge proponent of open source software, and I'd love to release the code for this project as soon as possible. For competitive reasons, I intend to do this either after I hit my sales benchmark, or after a long enough period of time has passed. I realize this sounds pretty wishy-washy right now, but I want to at least put this out there as a sort of pledge. Stay posted!</p>
